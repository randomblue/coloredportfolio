        <p>I'm a JavaScript developer with a passion for building innovate web applications with React and creating beautiful
          designs with CSS. I love creative thinking and problem solving, so I'm always excited to jump in and learn any
          framework or language. People always know me for my positive attitude, but I believe my strongest traits are my
          determination to create a solution and my willingness to fail and experiment. These characteristics are what allows
          me to excel in programming.</p>
        <p> When I'm not tacking JavaScript, I enjoy hiking with my wife, ice skating, or learning Japanese. I'm a big fan of
          personal development, so I enjoy implementing new productivity hacks or reading books such as: The Unthethered
          Soul or Think and Grow Rich.</p>
        <p> I'm extremely eager to jump into the market as a programmer and also delve into areas surrounding big data and artificial
          intelligence. As I grow as a developer, I'm aspiring to create innovative, progressive web applications that utilize
          machine learning and data analysis to create an immersive, exceptional user experience.</p>
